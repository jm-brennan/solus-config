In general, Solus/Budgie requires very little configuration for me to be happy with it, but I have found a few things that I like to customize. These are the scripts/example files that I use to do so. Some of these, particularly the wallpaper switcher took a while to figure out and I feel could be helpful to others. Use at your own risk, no guarantees that they will work on any system but mine.
